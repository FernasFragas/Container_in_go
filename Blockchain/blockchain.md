# Blockchain

## What is Blockchain

- blockchain is just a database with certain structure: itâ€™s an ordered, back-linked list.
  Meaning that blocks are stored in the insertion order and that each block is linked to the previous one. 
  This structure allows to quickly get the latest block in a chain and to (efficiently) get a block by its hash.
